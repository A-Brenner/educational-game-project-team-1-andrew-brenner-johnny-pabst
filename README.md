## Elevator Pitch
*Flight of the Spotted Lanternfly is a game designed to educate middle school students about the dangers of the Spotted Lanternfly species, a fairly new invasive species currently affecting rural areas on the East Coast. In the game, you take the role of a Spotted Lanternfly, while witnessing the destruction first-hand that these swarms can cause by attacking host plants. Taken under the wing of the Spotted Lanternfly Crime Boss, Buzz Capone, you've been sent to infest the rural landscape.*
